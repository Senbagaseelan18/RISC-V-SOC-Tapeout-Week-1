## 📝 Introduction to Optimization  
Optimization in digital design focuses on improving the circuit for **area, power, and performance efficiency**. It can be classified into **Combinational Logic Optimization** and **Sequential Optimization**.  

---

## 🔹 Combinational Logic Optimization  
- **Constant Propagation** – Eliminating redundant constants in logic expressions.  
- **Boolean Logic Optimization** – Simplifying Boolean equations to reduce gate count.  

---

## 🔹 Sequential Optimization  

### Basic  
- **Sequential Constant Propagation** – Removing unnecessary sequential logic based on constant values.  

### Advanced  
- **State Optimization** – Reducing redundant states in FSMs.  
- **Sequential Logic Cloning** – Duplicating registers to improve timing/performance.  
- **Retiming** – Repositioning registers for better performance without changing functionality.
