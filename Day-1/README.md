# üõ†Ô∏è Day 1 ‚Äì Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis

Welcome to **Day 1** of the RTL Workshop!  
Today, you'll start your journey into digital design by learning Verilog, open-source simulation with **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)**, and waveform analysis with **GTKWave**. This guide walks you through practical labs, essential concepts, and hands-on exercises.

## 1. Getting Started with Verilog Simulation

**iverilog** is an open-source Verilog simulator that compiles and runs your RTL designs.  
A **testbench** is used to apply inputs and verify your design outputs.

### Setting Up Your Design

- Both the **design** and **testbench** files are compiled together.  
- The simulator generates a `.vcd` file for waveform viewing in GTKWave.

## 2. Lab: Bad Counter

In this lab, you will design and simulate a **bad counter** to understand sequential logic and register behavior.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
